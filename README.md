My experience putting together my home cyber security lab

So it took me some time to decide what hardware I would use. I did intially favour buying one powerful desktop machine with 64gb of RAM capable of running multiple vms. But I realised that if I wanted to run OPNSense as my firewall and IDS I would need a wired connection from my Virgin modem into the OPNSense machine. So this would entail the PC tower being in my front room. For the time being at least. So I sought alterntives. As it was Black Friday at the time I bought 4 mini pcs witt a total of 64gb ram. 2 of the mini pcs came with 2 NICs. I will admit when I ordered them I didn't know with but it has turned out to be very useful.

For my first attempt I installed Proxmox on all 4 mini pcs and intended to run 3 of them in a cluster.
